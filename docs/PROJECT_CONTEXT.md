# Project Context — ContentCenter as Fred’s Personal Website (Onboarding)

## Purpose

Build a **premium personal website** that becomes Fred’s canonical professional home:

* Showcase AI projects with credible proof
* Publish helpful writing (blog) that compounds discoverability via Google
* Make it dead-simple for the right people to contact Fred

## What “success” looks like

* A first-time visitor understands **who Fred helps + what he builds + why it matters** in ~10 seconds.
* Projects read like **case studies** (not a screenshot graveyard): problem → constraints → approach → results → artifacts.
* Publishing is consistent and clearly authored (byline + About context), aligning with Google’s “people-first” and “Who/How/Why” guidance. ([Google for Developers][1])
* The site is fast, stable, and accessible (feels premium, works for everyone).

## Target audiences

* Potential clients (exec/ops): want outcomes, credibility, clear CTA
* Partners/peers: want depth and clarity of thinking
* Recruiters: want quick proof of capability
* Search engines: need clear structure and signals to understand and index pages

## Scope

### In scope (now)

* All content is **public/free** (no login, no paywall, no newsletter)
* Core pages + content templates (Posts + Projects/Case Studies)
* Strong information architecture, internal linking, and SEO foundations (crawl clarity)

### Out of scope (explicit)

* Newsletter sending, subscriptions, memberships
* User accounts, comments, gated content, payments
* Heavy analytics or growth tooling

## Content principles (non-negotiables)

* **Helpful > hype**: original experience, real lessons, concrete artifacts. ([Google for Developers][1])
* **Proof-first**: each showcased project must include evidence (screens, diagrams, links, demos).
* **Consistency**: repeatable templates for posts and case studies.

## Site structure (what we’re building)

* Home (positioning + featured projects + featured writing + contact CTA)
* About (story, credibility, current focus)
* Projects (index + filters by topic)
* Project detail (case study template)
* Blog (index + tags)
* Blog post (template + related content)
* Contact (single clear CTA)

SEO essentials included conceptually: clear crawling rules (robots), discoverability (sitemap), and obvious authorship. ([Google for Developers][2])

## Collaboration expectations

* Default to **small, shippable increments** (ship weekly, improve continuously).
* Treat copy, layout, and content structure as first-class product work (not “marketing later”).
* Every page should answer: *What is this? Why should I care? What can I do next?*

## Your first wins (suggested starter tasks)

1. Draft one **project case study** using the agreed template (Problem → Constraints → Approach → Results → Artifacts).
2. Draft one **blog post** that teaches a practical lesson from real work.
3. Ensure navigation and page structure make the above discoverable from Home.
