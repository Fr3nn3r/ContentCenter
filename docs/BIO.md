Got it — I tried to open your LinkedIn directly, but it’s blocked to automated readers (robots restriction). So I couldn’t “read” the full page end-to-end. What I *could* use reliably is the public snippet LinkedIn exposes in search (your opening line + positioning), plus your other public profiles (AI Swiss Knife on F6S, Innovation Zurich listing, and the Genioo recognition article) to write a **personal-website bio** that matches your current positioning. ([LinkedIn][1])

Below are two website-ready versions (long + short).

## Personal website bio (long)

I build **audit-first AI systems** that remove bottlenecks in real businesses — especially in insurance, where “move fast” only counts if you can still explain *why* the system did what it did. ([LinkedIn][1])

I’m **Frédéric Brunner**, founder of **AI Swiss Knife**, based in **Dübendorf (Zurich area)**. I’m a hands-on architect: I design the workflow, ship the MVP, and make sure it survives real operations (edge cases, messy documents, governance, and the dreaded “can we audit this?” meeting). ([F6S][2])

### What I do

I develop “done-for-you” and “audit-first” AI solutions that turn unstructured documents into reliable actions: opening claims, checking coverage, cross-checking information across documents, and proposing the next best action (including human-in-the-loop when it matters). ([F6S][2])

In practice, that means combining:

* **LLMs** for understanding language and documents
* **structured outputs + deterministic checks** for consistency and control
* **traceable decision trails** so teams can trust (and defend) outcomes

### Why I’m obsessed with “audit-first”

Because most AI projects don’t fail on intelligence — they fail on **trust**. If you can’t explain a decision, you can’t scale it in a regulated environment. I’m here to build the kind of AI that doesn’t collapse the moment it hits compliance, QA, or production reality.

### My background

I bring long-run delivery experience from enterprise environments and decades of programming, with deep exposure to insurance execution. ([F6S][2])
Before focusing fully on building, I led and grew consulting work — including being recognized by Consulting Magazine for client service excellence through Genioo. ([Genioo][3])

### If you’re wondering whether we should talk

If you’re an insurer, broker, or services leader trying to reduce cycle time, improve QA, or automate document-heavy work *without* losing control — we should have a conversation. I’m happiest when we can point to something concrete in a few weeks: a working prototype, measurable impact, and a clear path to production.

*(I like practical AI. The kind that still works on Monday morning. Even when the documents are… “creative.”)* ([F6S][2])

## Personal website bio (short)

I’m Frédéric Brunner — founder of **AI Swiss Knife** in the Zurich area. I build **audit-first AI** for insurance: systems that process messy documents, automate real operational actions, and produce an explainable trail teams can trust. ([F6S][2])

If your business has bottlenecks and you want AI that holds up in production (and in audits), let’s talk. ([LinkedIn][1])
