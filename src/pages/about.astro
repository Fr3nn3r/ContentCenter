        I'm Fred Brunner, an AI Solutions Architect based in [Location].
        I help insurance and operations teams build AI systems that actually work in production.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in turning chaotic, manual workflows into structured, auditable processes.
        My focus is on practical AI applications where reliability and explainability matter
        more than impressive demos.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        [Your background story here - previous roles, how you got into AI, what drives you]
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Claims processing automation for insurance</li>
        <li>QA and compliance workflows with AI assistance</li>
        <li>Prompt engineering and LLM reliability patterns</li>
        <li>Building agentic systems that are debuggable and auditable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in shipping small, working increments. Every system I build prioritizes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - It needs to work consistently, not just in demos</li>
        <li><strong>Auditability</strong> - Every decision should be traceable</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability</strong> - Teams need to own it after I'm gone</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
      <p>
