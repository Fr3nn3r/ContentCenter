        <p class="mt-4 text-xl text-charcoal/80">
          I'm Frederic Brunner, founder of <strong class="text-owl-green">AI Swiss Knife</strong>, based in Dübendorf (Zurich area), Switzerland.
          I build <strong class="text-hot-pink">audit-first AI systems</strong> that remove bottlenecks in real businesses—especially in insurance,
          where "move fast" only counts if you can still explain <em>why</em> the system did what it did.

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I develop done-for-you AI solutions that turn unstructured documents into reliable actions:
        opening claims, checking coverage, cross-checking information across documents, and proposing
        the next best action (including human-in-the-loop when it matters).
      </p>
      <p>In practice, that means combining:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LLMs</strong> for understanding language and documents</li>
        <li><strong>Structured outputs + deterministic checks</strong> for consistency and control</li>
        <li><strong>Traceable decision trails</strong> so teams can trust (and defend) outcomes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Audit-First</h2>
      <p>
        Most AI projects don't fail on intelligence—they fail on <strong>trust</strong>.
        If you can't explain a decision, you can't scale it in a regulated environment.
        I build AI that doesn't collapse the moment it hits compliance, QA, or production reality.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I bring over 20 years of experience spanning software engineering, enterprise architecture,
        and delivery leadership in insurance IT transformations. Before focusing fully on building,
        I led and grew consulting work—including serving as a Guidewire Engagement Director and
        being recognized by Consulting Magazine for client service excellence through Genioo.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Focus</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Claims processing automation for insurance</li>
        <li>QA and compliance workflows with AI assistance</li>
        <li>Prompt engineering and LLM reliability patterns</li>
        <li>Agentic systems that are debuggable and auditable</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
      <p>
        If you're an insurer, broker, or services leader trying to reduce cycle time,
        improve QA, or automate document-heavy work without losing control—<a href="/contact">let's talk</a>.
        I'm happiest when we can point to something concrete in a few weeks: a working prototype,
        measurable impact, and a clear path to production.
